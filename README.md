The Movies App

This project consists, as requested, in the creation of an app to view information about movies and in turn have the option to buy.
FIRST, IN ORDER TO VIEW THE FILE CORRECTLY, YOU MUST UNZIP THE THEMOVIESAPP.ZIP FOLDER

The project is made up of 3 main files, which make up the structure of the website:
- index.html
- top.html
- latest.html

Later, we can see that it has 4 folders, in each of them there is information about the images used, and code as appropriate:
- css
- img
- js
- scss

To successfully open the project, once you unzip the folder, select the index.html file.

On the main page, you will find a main image with information, then a section with recommended movies that contains a carousel with different movies to watch, you can move the carousel from left to right and from right to left, you can even see a hover effect, when placing the cursor on the image.

Then follow the section that shows a little about the top 10 movies, you can see a small list with the option to go directly to the top 10 page, as well as the next section that would be the last movies.

In the upper part of the main page, in the upper left part you can locate a button to access the menu, it will show an effect appearing from the left side of the screen, the menu options contain an effect when placing the cursor on each one of them.

At the end of the page, the footer is shown, with icons for social networks, which take effect when you hover over each one of them.

Top 10

On this page you can find our list of the top 10, with information on each of them, different effects are shown when you move the mouse over the image, the card and the button to view more information and the trailer.

Once the button is pressed, a pop-up window will open with more information about the film and a video with the corresponding trailer.

Latest Movies

On this page you will find the list of the latest movies, with the same information as the movies included in the top 10.

This page includes an option to purchase the movies you want.

The main page is responsive so the information on the main page can be viewed from mobile or tablet.
